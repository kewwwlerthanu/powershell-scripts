## My PowerShell Scripts
As requested, here is a list of all the scripts I could make generic, and that aren't exclusive to where I work.  I am still new to PowerShell, so forgive me if my scripts seem stupid or not helpful.  If you open up a script, I explain what it does in the comments.  Also, in general I need to add in some more error checking and verification of success, because normally I am so used to being the only person who uses the script, so I know what not to do.

*Powershell-Cmdlet-Explorer* lists all installed modules, and by clicking on a module, you can see the cmdlets for that module. When you click on a cmdlet, you can see the help information for it.

You can check each script's file for a description of what it does.

That's it!  If you have any tips on how to improve these scripts, let me know!
